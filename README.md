Hello, this is a very rudimentary (but work-in-progress) data analysis package developed from thermoelectric measureemnts using vibrating sample magnetometry. 

The current functionality includes signal thresholding & enveloping, interpolation, as well as symmetrization and anti-symmetrization.

Feel free to adapt and use the package as your own, and if you have any suggestions, here is my email - ikanade@umich.edu
